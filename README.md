*I didn't have time to build a decent pong game,
so I started building a pong game building machine.*

## Introduction to META PONG

Meta Pong is a pong-like video game, built with Haskell,
and an experiment in efficient free software development.
It is owned by its player-contributors.

The game began on 2019-11-18, and new player-contributors are welcome.
Would you like to get involved right now ?
You can play at any of these levels:

- **Gamer**: - 
Install and enjoy the game (the most popular version of it. This doesn't exist yet.)

- **Tester** - 
Play alternate versions of the game, vote on them, provide testing & feedback.

- **Developer** - 
Improve the game, propose new versions of the game, following the Process.

- **Maintainer** - 
Package and deliver the game, maintain the project, define/improve the Process.

- **Haskeller** - 
Improve the haskell games ecosystem (in ways relating to this project).

<!-- And of course only the Emperor can play this role: -->

<!-- Provide infrastructure and judgements. -->

This evolving document defines our Process and serves as the Rules of Play.

Meta Pong's goals include:

- rapid production and delivery of wholesome FUN (and some KNOWHOW and EDUCATION)
- efficient collaboration, decision making, and engagement
- minimisation of toil, single-dev burnout and unhelpful STRESS
- advancement of the Haskell games scene

Our techniques/principles include:

- crowd-sourced playtesting and maintenance
- evolutionary product and process development
- Nomic style meta-gaming
- FUN, RESPECT and PERSISTENCE

The project's scope is limited to:
"pong-like games". There shall be a bouncing ball.

For practical reasons, infrastructure, broom-pushing and judgements are provided by the EMP:

By imperial decree this day Monday the 18th of November, 2019 CE., 
the EMP is (unless deposed.. but how..?):

And the game of Meta Pong is declared open.
