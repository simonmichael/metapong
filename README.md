# META PONG

*I didn't have time to build a decent pong game,
so I built a pong game building machine.* --the EMP

Meta Pong is a pong-like video game, and an experiment in
collaborative, efficient, haskell-based game development.

Meta Pong is owned by its player-contributors. 
New player-contributors are always welcome.
Would you like to get involved right now ?

You can play at any of these levels:

- pong - play the (most popular version of) the game itself

- pongtest - play alternate versions of the game, vote on them, provide testing & feedback

- pongdev - improve the game, propose new versions of the game, following the documented process

- pongmaint - game packaging and delivery, project maintenance, process improvement

- haskgame - improving the haskell games ecosystem (in ways relating to this project)

Meta Pong's goals include:

- rapid production and delivery of wholesome FUN (and some KNOWHOW and EDUCATION)
- efficient collaboration, decision making, and engagement
- minimisation of toil, single-dev burnout and unhelpful STRESS
- advancement of the Haskell games scene

Our techniques/principles include:

- crowd-sourced playtesting and maintenance
- evolutionary product and process development
- Nomic style meta-gaming
- FUN, KINDNESS and PERSISTENCE

The project's scope is limited to:
"pong-like games". There shall be a bouncing ball.

For practicality, the project's infrastructure and overall
broom-pushing and adjudication is provided by the Founder:
