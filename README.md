*I didn't have time to build a decent pong game,
so I started building a pong game building machine.*

Meta Pong is a pong-like video game, built with Haskell,
and an experiment in efficient development.
It is owned by its player-contributors.

New player-contributors are always welcome.
Would you like to get involved right now ?
You can play at any of these levels:

1. ponggame  - install and enjoy the game (the most popular version of it. this doesn't exist yet.)

2. pongtest  - play alternate versions of the game, vote on them, provide testing & feedback

3. pongdev   - improve the game, propose new versions of the game, following the PROCESS

4. pongmaint - package and deliver the game, maintain the project, *and* define/improve the PROCESS

5. haskgame  - improve the haskell games ecosystem (in ways relating to this project)

This evolving document defines our PROCESS and serves as the Rules of Play.

Meta Pong's goals include:

- rapid production and delivery of wholesome FUN (and some KNOWHOW and EDUCATION)
- efficient collaboration, decision making, and engagement
- minimisation of toil, single-dev burnout and unhelpful STRESS
- advancement of the Haskell games scene

Our techniques/principles include:

- crowd-sourced playtesting and maintenance
- evolutionary product and process development
- Nomic style meta-gaming
- FUN, RESPECT and PERSISTENCE

The project's scope is limited to:
"pong-like games". There shall be a bouncing ball.

For practical reasons, infrastructure, broom-pushing and judgements are provided by the EMP:

By imperial decree this day Monday the 18th of November, 2019 CE., 
the EMP is (unless deposed.. but how..?):

And the game of Meta Pong is declared open.
